# Introduction

The goal of this study is to analyze the influence of syllable weight on the perception of stress by late L2 learners of Spanish.

## Research Questions
How do late L2 learners of Spanish decide where to place lexical stress in the absence of acoustic cues?
- The hypothesis being tested is that late learners will rely on the weight of the syllable to aid them in perceiving stressed syllables

As proficiency increases in the L2, the perception of stressed syllables becomes more and more native-like, therefore, we expect a positive correlation between a learner’s proficiency and their ability to perceive the correct stressed syllable

To what extent does the phonological structure of language influence speech perception? (adopted from Hume & Johnson (1999)).
- We expect the late learner to become more attuned to the unmarked Spanish stress patterns as they become more proficient in the language.

# Methods

.pull-left[
## Participants
- 68 subjects took part in this study
- second language learners of Spanish of varying proficiencies
- All participants were from Middleberry College
]

.pull-right[
## Stimuli
- modified natural recordings of the words _fafa_, _fufu_, and _fafal_
- combinations of different measures of duration and intensity were created for each of the words which produced stressed syllables that were either clear paroxytone, paroxytone, neutral, oxytone, or clear oxytone
- (25 variations x 3 words x 4 repetitions = 300 total)
- this study focuses on the data where the intensity and duration were 0.

# Methods

## The Study
- Completed proficiency test before beginning perception portion
- two-alternative forced choice task
- asked to identify the location of stress (first or second syllable) in disyllabic nonce words _fafa_, _fufu_, and _fafal_ by clicking the ‘1’ or ‘0’ keys on the keyboard
- The order in which the words were presented to the participants was randomly assigned.
- The average time to complete the experiment was 20 minutes.
- The results of the proficiency test and perception experiment were recorded by the computer and collected at the end of the experiment

### Criterion: proportion of oxytone responses

# 1. Check for Linearity

.pull-left[
``` {r, plot, fig.align= 'center', fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
span_stress

### Linear!
]

.pull-right[
# 2. Mean of Residuals = 0

``` {r, diagnostics_2}
mean(mod_int$residuals)

### Close enough 🤷🏻

.pull-left[
# 3. No Autocorrelation

```{r, diagnostics_3, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
acf(mod_int$residuals)
```
- A little concerning at x = 0
- This is probably happening because of the _condition_ _x_ _proficiency_ interaction.

# 4. Homoskedasticity
``` {r, diagnostics_4, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
plot(fitted(mod_int), residuals(mod_int))
```
- the points are clustering on the left-hand side of the plot a little
- When in doubt blame the interaction

# Discussion
Findings support the hypothesis that late learners of Spanish use the weight of the syllable in the absence of acoustic cues to aid in the perception of stress.This was shown to be in true for both conditions ( _fafa_, _fafal_). As proficiency increased the proportion of oxytone responses increased when the final syllable was heavy, in other words, learners perceived the final syllable to be stressed when the final syllable was heavy. We also saw that as proficiency increased the proportion of oxytone responses decreased in disyllabic words with light syllables.

As proficiency increases the learner becomes more attuned to the unmarked stressed patterns of their L2, which, in Spanish, is to stress the penultimate syllable in words that have light final syllables and the final syllable in words that have a heavy final syllable.

Syllable weight influencing the perception of stress by late learners of Spanish shows that phonological structure of language influences speech perception to an extent.

# Conclusion

The present study examined the influence of syllable weight on the perception of stress by late learners of Spanish. Findings support the hypothesis that late learners of Spanish use the weight of the syllable in the absence of acoustic cues. This suggests that as a learner’s proficiency increases they are becoming more attuned to the unmarked stress patterns in Spanish. This is important because it supports the claim that phonological structure of language influences speech perception.
